# Welcome!

My name is Sue and I am a software engineer. My work focuses on civil engineering applications such as:

- developing data analytic platforms for traffic and pedestrian safety
- creating BIM and VR enviornments of high-profile facilities
- building 3D printed models of bridges and structures for engineering review

I also enjoy art, technical writing, and 3D printing. Check out my portfolio on my [website](https://seumoo.com/).
